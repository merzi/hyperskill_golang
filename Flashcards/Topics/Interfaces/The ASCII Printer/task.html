<p>Bruno really likes ASCII Art and emojis; he wants to create an <code class="java">AsciiPrinter</code> interface that allows him to read ASCII Art from the <em>ascii_art.txt</em> file.</p>

<p>Bruno has already created the <code class="java">File</code> string type; it will hold the file name, which must be a string.</p>

<p>Your task is to help Bruno write the required additional code to create the <code class="java">AsciiPrinter</code> interface and afterwards call the <code class="java">AsciiPrinter</code> within the <code class="java">main</code> function to read the <em>ascii_art.txt</em> file and then print the read ASCII Art to the console.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">This problem uses the <code class="java">ReadFile</code> function from the <code class="java">os</code> package to read the ASCII Art contained within the <em>ascii_art.txt</em> file. To solve this task, you don't need to know how to read from files or how the <code class="java">os</code> package works. Your only objective is to create the <code class="java">AsciiPrinter</code> interface and then call it within the main function.</div></p>
