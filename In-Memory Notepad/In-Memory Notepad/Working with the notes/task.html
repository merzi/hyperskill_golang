<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>Your notepad is already handy, but it's not that user-friendly. For example, you cannot delete an individual note; you need to delete all of them only to create the ones you really need. Let's improve this by adding two new commands – <code class="java">update</code> and <code class="java">delete</code>.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<p>Modify the solution for the previous stage by adding new commands – <code class="java">update</code> and <code class="java">delete</code>.</p>

<p>When the command is <code class="java">update</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The program should use a space (<code class="java">"<span style="color: #6a8759;"> </span>"</code>) as a separator to split the data into two pieces – the position (an integer) and the text (a string). Update the text of a note at the given position.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the command is <code class="java">delete</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The program should interpret the data as a position, delete a note at the given position, and clear this position. Be careful to properly update the remaining positions: the position of a note should represent the order of the notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program has to check the position and note before executing the <code class="java">update</code> or <code class="java">delete</code> commands:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If there is no note at the given position, print <code class="java">[Error] There is nothing to update\n</code> or <code class="java">[Error] There is nothing to delete\n</code>;</li>
	<li>If the program cannot convert the given position-string to the position(an integer), print <code class="java">[Error] Invalid position: %s\n</code>, where <code class="java">%s</code> is the string;</li>
	<li>If the program cannot find the position-string, print <code class="java">[Error] Missing position argument\n</code>;</li>
	<li>If the program cannot find the note-string, print <code class="java">[Error] Missing note argument\n</code>;</li>
	<li>If the position is out-of-boundaries, print <code class="java">[Error] Position %d is out of the boundaries [1, %d]\n</code>, where the second <code class="java">%d</code> is the internal storage size;</li>
	<li>If the operation was successful, print <code class="java">[OK] The note at position %d was successfully updated\n</code> or <code class="java">[OK] The note at position %d was successfully deleted\n</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>program execution; one of the update and delete command is followed by a few spaces</em></p>
