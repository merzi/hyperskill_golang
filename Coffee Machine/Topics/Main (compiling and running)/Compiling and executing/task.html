  <p>Suppose you are working on an unfinished Go program. Now you want to execute it, but not create a binary executable file in your workspace. What <code class="java">go</code> command should you use?</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   Remember to add the 
   <code class="java">go</code> suffix before the command name. Also, it is not required to write the .go source file name after the command!
