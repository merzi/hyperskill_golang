  <p><a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Dyrus" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dyrus</a> has created a slice with his favorite old-school League of Legends champions. However, he wants to sort it based on the length of each name of the champion â€” the shortest name first and the longest name last!</p> 
  <p>Please help him implement the sorting function required for this task. To do this, you will need to use the <code class="java">sort.Slice()</code> function along with the builtin function <code class="java">len</code> on the names of each champion!</p>
