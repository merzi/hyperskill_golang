<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>In the previous stage, the maximum number of notes was hard-coded into the program. It is not outright bad, but if you want to store, for example, 7 notes, you need to change and re-compile the whole program. Let's extend your program by having a dynamically allocated storage of an arbitrary size. In this stage, you will still have the upper limit for the size; it will be assigned at the start-up instead of being hard-coded.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<p>Modify the solution for the previous stage to achieve the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At the start-up, the program should print <code class="java">Enter the maximum number of notes:</code>, then read an integer from the standard input. This integer value should be interpreted by the program as the maximum number of notes inside the program at any given time. If users try to exceed this value via the <code class="java">create</code> command, the program must raise the corresponding error from the previous stage;</li>
	<li>When the program receives an unspecified command, it should print <code class="java">[Error] Unknown command</code>;</li>
	<li>When the program receives the <code class="java">create</code> command followed by an empty string or by a bunch of spaces, print <code class="java">Missing note argument\n</code> ;</li>
	<li>If the program has no notes, the <code class="java">list</code> command should print <code class="java">[Info] Notepad is empty</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>program execution.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter the maximum number of notes: &gt; 3

Enter a command and data: &gt; list
[Info] Notepad is empty

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my first record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; list
[Info] 1: This is my first record!

Enter a command and data: &gt; clear
[OK] All notes were successfully deleted

Enter a command and data: &gt; list
[Info] Notepad is empty

Enter a command and data: &gt; exit
[Info] Bye!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>program execution; one of the create command here is followed by a few spaces.</em> </p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter the maximum number of notes: &gt; 3

Enter a command and data: &gt; create
[Error] Missing note argument

Enter a command and data: &gt; create
[Error] Missing note argument

Enter a command and data: &gt; get 2
[Error] Unknown command

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my first record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my second record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my third record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my forth record!
[Error] Notepad is full

Enter command and data: &gt; list
[Info] 1: This is my first record!
[Info] 2: This is my second record!
[Info] 3: This is my third record!

Enter a command and data: &gt; clear
[OK] All notes were successfully deleted

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my forth record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; list
[Info] 1: This is my forth record!

Enter a command and data: &gt; exit
[Info] Bye!
