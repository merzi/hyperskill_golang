  <p>Patrick has created a Go program that takes as input his old favorite rapper <code class="java">firstName</code> and <code class="java">lastName</code> and then uses the function <code class="java">updateRapper</code> to update the name of his favorite rapper within his Go program. However, when he tried to execute his program, his function couldn't update the values of the variables <code class="java">firstName</code> and <code class="java">lastName</code>.</p> 
  <p>Can you help Patrick fix the <code class="java">updateRapper</code> function? He needs the function to specifically update <code class="java">firstName</code> to Kanye and <code class="java">lastName</code> to West, as Kanye West is his new favorite rapper.</p> 
  <p></p>

   Take notice that to solve this task, it is not necessary to change any code within the 
   <code class="java">main</code> function; the objective is to fix the 
   <code class="java">updateRapper</code> function as it has errors in both the parameter type declaration and in the type of the variables used within it as well!
