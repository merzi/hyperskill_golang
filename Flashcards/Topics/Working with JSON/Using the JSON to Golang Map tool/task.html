  <p>Lena is working with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.floatrates.com/json-feeds.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">floatrates JSON data feed</a>; before writing any code, she wants to know what the JSON object returned by floatrates would look like, converted into its Go Interface Map representation.</p> 
  <p>Below is an extract from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.floatrates.com/daily/usd.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">floatrates JSON response for USD conversion rates</a>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-json">{
   "eur":{
      "code":"EUR",
      "alphaCode":"EUR",
      "numericCode":"978",
      "name":"Euro",
      "rate":0.91998122665272,
      "date":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 11:55:01 GMT",
      "inverseRate":1.0869787024225
   }

  <p>Since you always pay attention to every detail of the topic theory, you surely remember that the last theory section talked about the <a target="_blank" href="https://rodrigo-brito.github.io/json-to-go-map/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JSON to Golang Map tool</a>, used to convert a JSON object into a Go interface representation.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to help Lena use the <a target="_blank" href="https://rodrigo-brito.github.io/json-to-go-map/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JSON to Golang Map tool</a> to convert the above extract of the JSON object returned by floatrates, and then simply copy and paste its correct Go Interface Map representation to the textbox below:</p>
