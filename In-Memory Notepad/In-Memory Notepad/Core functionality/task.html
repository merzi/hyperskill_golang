<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>In this stage, we will work on the basic functionality of our CLI program. It includes the ability to create, print, or delete all notes.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Modify the solution for the previous stage by adding three new commands â€“ <code class="java">create</code>, <code class="java">list</code>, and <code class="java">clear</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the command is <code class="java">create</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The program should interpret the data as a type string and make a new note that contains this text. The program should be capable of storing up to 5 notes in its memory. The number of notes is a random number. We guarantee that it will be a relatively small number to provide the readability and test-ability;</li>
	<li>If the operation was successful, the program should print <code class="java">[OK] The note was successfully created\n</code>;</li>
	<li>If users try to exceed the maximum number of notes, print <code class="java">[Error] Notepad is full\n</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the command is <code class="java">clear</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The program should delete all records and print <code class="java">[OK] All notes were successfully deleted\n</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the command is <code class="java">list</code>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The program should print all entries using <code class="java">[Info] %d: %s\n</code> as a format string. It contains the position (as an integer) and the text of a note at this position. The position starts at <code class="java">1</code>. Don't print empty entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program should run in an infinite loop and terminate only when the <code class="java">exit</code> command is received.</p>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>program execution</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my first record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; list
[Info] 1: This is my first record!

Enter a command and data: &gt; clear
[OK] All notes were successfully deleted

Enter a command and data: &gt; list

Enter a command and data: &gt; exit
[Info] Bye!</code></pre>

<p> <strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>program execution</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my first record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my second record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my third record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my forth record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my fifth record!
[OK] The note was successfully created

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my sixth record!
[Error] Notepad is full

Enter command and data: &gt; list
[Info] 1: This is my first record!
[Info] 2: This is my second record!
[Info] 3: This is my third record!
[Info] 4: This is my forth record!
[Info] 5: This is my fifth record!

Enter a command and data: &gt; clear
[OK] All notes were successfully deleted

Enter a command and data: &gt; create This is my sixth record!
