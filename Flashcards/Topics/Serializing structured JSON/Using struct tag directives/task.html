<h2>Using struct tag directives</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Edwin is a doctor; he has created a Go program that has the <code class="java">Appointment</code> struct that will hold important data about his patients' medical appointments. This way, his secretary will check and organize his schedule for the month of <code class="java">April</code>.</p> 
  <p>Since his secretary should not know the private details about what Dr. Edwin will discuss with patients during the medical appointment (due to Doctor-Patient confidentiality), he wants to make sure the <code class="java">Description</code> field is not encoded to JSON.</p> 
  <p>Dr. Edwin has already written the required code to take as an input the values for the <code class="java">Appointment</code> struct and serialize it to JSON afterward. However, he needs your help to properly add the correct JSON struct tags to his code to follow the <code class="java">camelCase</code> naming convention and use the correct directive to make the <code class="java">Description</code> field never be encoded to JSON.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   This problem uses the 
   <code class="java">time</code> package to calculate a specific date appointment with the 
   <code class="java">time.Time</code> struct and 
   <code class="java">time.Date()</code> functions. However, to solve this task, you don't need to know how the 
   <code class="java">time</code> package works. The only objective is to add the correct JSON struct tags along with the right directives to achieve the serialized output Dr. Edwin wants.

  <p>Below is the code Dr. Edwin has written so far:</p>
